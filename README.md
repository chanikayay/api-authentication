# api-authentication
Learn about No Authentication, Basic Authentication, API Key Authorisationm, Token Based Authentication, and Base64. <br>
This is an API that I used: https://secrets-api.appbrewery.com/
<h4>Differences</h4>
<ol>
<li>No auth: no security door</li>
<li>Basic Auth: require username & password</li>
<li>API Key: for calling project. for clients that are alllowed to use the service. can ebe used with authentitcation to obtain API key</li>
<li>Token: require username & password to generate unique token.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Reminder</h4>
- In order to make them functional, we have to register username and password via Postman first, then fill up those inputs (yourUsername and yourPassword) inside the code.<br>
- npm install in the terminal before running the server.
